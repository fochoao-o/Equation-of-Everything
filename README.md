any intenger meaning 1 as an integer or logarithmns or algorithmns.

E = T = L = (x1-,y+,x+,y-) = (y+,x-,y+,x-) + E = T = L

Substitution

(x+/2)+z1+z2+z3+z4 = 
(-x/2)-z1-z1-z3-z4

(+y/2)+z1+z2+z3+z4 =
(-y/2)-z1-z2-z3-z4

(4/2)+z1+z2+z3+z4 =
(-4/2)-z1-z2-z3-z4

This couldn't have been possible, first thanks to all my family, especially my dad and mom, my sisters, so my mentors, my dad, guys like OpenGPG founder, the IBM with the Mandelbrot Fractal, the guy from Apple who invented the elliptic curve, GRiYO which I took all his DDE calls during 96's from one of his DLL's, we emailed each other. Noam Chomsky, Bhaskar Pant, Federico Quijada, John Nash, Einstein, Turing, Stephen Hawking. This could not have been possible without the M.I.T. Education. From everyone You learn something in particular, therefore everyone who works in an Industrial Workshop. As an IT engineer, who programs in at least ten languages, and knows some different cultural languages. Neurologist from a former MIT Neurologist, I had to learn from her a lot, and knows General Medicine, Diagnosis too. A bit of history too, not too extended. Some of art. And advanced physics, learned way much about Chomsky in regards to history from each year the real one in regards of this. As well as a former NASA, Microsoft worker, and an Industrial Workshop 

27 years of studying and since I was 14 years old started working.

Essay.

Thanks everyone!
